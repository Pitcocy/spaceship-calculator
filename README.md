# ðŸš€ Spaceship Calculator

## Welcome to my first JavaScript project!

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share my very first coding project with you. 
This Spaceship Calculator is the result of my initial steps into the world of JavaScript. 

It ain't much, but it's honest work.

### What is this project?

This Spaceship Calculator is a fun, space-themed web application that performs basic arithmetic operations. 
It's designed to look like something you might find on a futuristic spaceship control panel. Pretty cool, right?

### My Learning Journey

As a complete beginner in programming, I decided to dive headfirst into JavaScript. 
This project represents my first real attempt at creating something functional. 

Every line of code here is a small victory in my learning process.

Here's what I've learned so far:

- Basic HTML structure
- CSS styling and animations
- JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation
- Handling user input and performing calculations
- Adding some interactivity and fun elements (like the flying rocket! ðŸš€)

### Features

- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Sleek, futuristic design with a space theme
- Animated background for that extra sci-fi feel
- A surprise rocket animation when you calculate!

### How to Use

1. Enter two numbers in the input fields
2. Select an operation from the dropdown menu
3. Click the "Calculate" button
4. Watch the result appear and enjoy the flying rocket!

### Final Thoughts

I'm sharing this project not because it's perfect, but because I'm proud of what I've accomplished as a beginner. 
If you're also just starting out with coding, I hope this inspires you to create and share your own projects, no matter how simple they might seem.

Remember, every expert was once a beginner. So let's keep learning, creating!

Feel free to explore the code, and if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear them.
